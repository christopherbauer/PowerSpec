###Building PowerSpec

##There's no PowerSpec.ps1 and other issues

To build powerspec, just go into the .\build folder and run Build.ps1. This will take all the files from the src folder and roll them togther into the PowerSpec.ps1 at the root of the projet. You can then take that single file wherever you need and bundle it alongside your actual spec.

Use the test file under .\test\Example.ps1 as an example of a spec with check.
